           The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and <transform playID="1">reprimands</transform>. <analysis playID="1">Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, <expand playID="1"><question playID="1">selecting the smoothest and roundest stones</question></expand>; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys.</analysis> The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.
           
           Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. <analysis playID="2">They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed.</analysis> The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.
           
           <analysis playID="3">The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween program--by Mr. Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him. because he had no children and his wife was a scold.</analysis> When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. <question playID="2" >The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool.</question> and when Mr. Summers said, "Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?" there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.

        <analysis playREF="1">The author's writing sytle seems to favor details. This sentence contains a lot of subordinate clauses.</analysis>
        <analysis playREF="2">This scene is a juxtaposition from the scene of the children collecting rocks and laughing. It emphasizes the fact that the adult are acting more "mature" than the children.</analysis>
        <analysis playREF="3">Again, the author uses subordinate clauses here to give detail about the events and the character. From this sentence, we learn how Summers looks like and about his personal affairs.</analysis>
        <expand playREF="1">Bobby reached down to his pockets, touching and rubbing the stone against his small hands.</expand>
        <question playREF="1">Why only smooth smooth stones? It is because the children view it to be more valuable?</question>
        <question playREF="2">Why did the villagers kept there distance? Is lottery a taboo? Or were they just being respectful?</question>
        <transform playREF="1">Back when I was still in ROTC, my friend and I got punished alot by the soldiers. After the session, all we seemed to talk about were the punishments that the soldiers gave us.</transform>
